# Arch Tools

These are random, one-off tools that I've developed for working with natural arch data. These very likely aren't useful for anyone but me. I've simply put them here for my own reference and in the unlikely even that they prove useful to someone else.

## What the Heck is This?

This is an extremely niche set of one-off tools/scripts that I've developed to make my life easier when doing research with natural arch data. If you find yourself asking what the heck that means, then this software likely isn't for you. Still, if you're curious, I'll try to provide a bit more context.

When I say **arch data**, I'm referring to landform data for (natural arches)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_arch]. The United States has many thousands of these amazing natural formations. There are many people, myself included, that work to find and document these natural formations. This is known as **arch hunting**.

If this all sounds incredibly niche, it's because it is!

# Current Tools

- `ProcessWAD.ps1` - A quick script to process GPX files downloaded from the World Arch Database into a CSV file. I use this CSV file for cross referencing other data sources.
